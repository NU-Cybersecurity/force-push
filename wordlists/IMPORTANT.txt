It should be noted that these wordslists come from various other products and
their licenses may apply to their specific usage. This is also not a terribly 
exhaustive directory of wordslists, and their intended application ranges from 
very specific to very general. https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists
has some more which you may add at your discretion based on your particular
